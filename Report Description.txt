"Sales Report.pbix" file contains a report showing information about the sales of products in a given company. The information we get is the number of products sold in a given period of time and the profit on sales. We can filter the data by the time period, mode of payment, or type of sale. Each product is divided into the appropriate category. The input data can be found in the file "Sales Dashboard Data.xlsx". They were transformed using the Power Query tool, and then used in building the report.
